# Capitaly
- Simulation of a simplified Capitaly game on a cyclical board.

## Three types of players:
- Greedy player: If the player steps on an unowned property, or their own property without a house, they start buying it, given that the player has enough money for it.
- Careful player: Buys in a round only for at most half the amount of their money.
- Tactical player: Skips each second chance when they player could buy.
