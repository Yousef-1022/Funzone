A package delivery driver loads as many products into his van as he can (considering the capacity of the van). The address of the destination is written on each product, so the distance (in kilometers) between the driver and the destination can be computed. The destinations are always gas stations (the PickPack points there), so the driver can refuel at each destination. The driver has to deliver all of the products that were put into his van. Delivering a product consists of the following steps:

1. the driver checks whether there is enough fuel to reach the destination.
2. if there is not enough fuel, the driver refuels the van. 
3. the driver starts the engine, drives to the destination(during which the van consumes fuel according to its consumption rate), stops the van, and unloads the product.

The van of the driver can be blue or yellow. The van has an engine, a fuel tank, and a hold to carry the products. The engine can be started and stopped. We can refuel the fuel tank up to its capacity. We know the consumption of the van, given in liters/km.
